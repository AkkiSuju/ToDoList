     and we are looking for it inside User Domain
     Mask i.e. user's home directory, that place
     where we are saving their personal items
     associated with this app.
     
     The urls method returns an array of URLs for
     the specified directory, so, we are grabbing
     its first item.
     
     We are adding a component i.e. a file to this
     path, which is a plist file in this case.
     And we will use this file to save user data
     persistently. */
